				<p class="opereffa">The feedback to my earlier enquiry on the  "top 5" clinical requirements
from the openEHR clinical community generated very positive and
interesting ideas, which were distilled into an appetite for an open
source clinical reference application to better understand the openEHR
mission. (Original post here; (<a href="http://www.nabble.com/openEHR-in-2009-and-beyond..-a-view-of-the-way-forward-td21623065.html#a21839379">http://www.nabble.com/openEHR-in-2009-and-beyond..-a-view-of-the-way-forward-td21623065.html#a21839379</a>
In brief the key requirements for this were..</p>


<p class="opereffa">#Make it open source/shared/free for all.
Enable networking of community and joint working between centres</p>


<p class="opereffa">#Aim for iterative development - starting with supporting clinicians to
do simple documentation, towards decision support
Archetype-Template-GUI support (to avoid handcoding everytime)
Listing of available archetypes- to allow for adhoc documentation
Blend of structured documentation  free text support</p>

<p class="opereffa">#Medications and Allergies - for epSOS compliance
Other clinical priorities as per SOAP noting ( including investigations,
results and medication prescribing)</p>


<p class="opereffa">These requirements have driven the development of this first release of
Opereffa.</p>
			
				<p class="opereffa">When facing the question of how to further focus this early work, I
					thought I would introduce you to an interesting and important push from
					the medical profession in the NHS in the UK, aimed at improving the
					standards of medical records.
					The Royal College of Physicians in London (in conjunction with the
					Academy of Medical Royal Colleges in the UK) has recently developed a
					set of Clinicians guides to Medical Record Standards, available <a href="http://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/clinical-standards/hiu/medical-records/Documents/Clinicians-Guide-Part-2-Standards.pdf">here</a>.
					</p>
					
				<p class="opereffa">Please look in particular at Section Two: Hospital admission record:
				headings and definitions. I hope these headings will be familiar to many
				medical doctors internationally, as they form the basis of the medical
				school "clerking" that many medical students are taught.They are also related to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP_note"> SOAP style of clinical noting </a>
				We have used these headings to form the basis for the very first set of
				<i>minimalist</i> <a href="ftp://opereffa.chime.ucl.ac.uk/archetypeRepository.zip">archetypes</a> 
				needed to support this clinical requirement in our demo application</p>
				
				<p class="opereffa">I hope this starting point should at least provide a useful basis for
				discussion and debate as we move this important development forward.</p>
